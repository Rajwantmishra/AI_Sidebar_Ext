## Introduction

Thank you for using the AI Sidebar Extension. We prioritize your privacy and are committed to being transparent about how your data is handled. This Privacy Policy explains that we do not collect or store any personal data on our servers and outlines how your interactions with the extension are managed.

## Data Collection and Usage

### 1. No Data Collection or Storage
- The AI Sidebar Extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to our servers. All data interactions occur locally within your browser.

### 2. OpenAI API Usage
- The extension interacts with the OpenAI API using the API key that you provide. While using the extension, your requests are sent directly to OpenAI's servers for processing. We do not intercept, store, or share these requests or any responses from OpenAI.
- All data usage related to the AI interactions is governed by OpenAI’s Privacy Policy. We recommend reviewing OpenAI’s Privacy Policy to understand how your data is handled by them.

## Third-Party Services

The only third-party service involved in the AI Sidebar Extension is the OpenAI API. Since no data is collected or stored by our extension, we rely solely on OpenAI to process the AI-related requests you make.

## Security

- **Local Storage**: Any settings, including your OpenAI API key, are stored locally within your browser. This data is not transmitted to any external servers.
- **No External Transmission**: The extension operates entirely within your browser, and no data is transmitted to our servers or any other third-party servers, except for OpenAI, as described above.

## Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Any updates will be posted on this page, so please review it periodically.
